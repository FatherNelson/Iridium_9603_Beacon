# Iridium 9603 Beacon #
#######################

A lightweight (70g including the batteries) Iridium + GPS Beacon (Tracker)
Suitable for High Altitude Ballooning

With grateful thanks to Mikal Hart:
Based on Mikal's IridiumSBD Beacon example: https://github.com/mikalhart/IridiumSBD
Requires Mikal's TinyGPS library: https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPS
and PString: http://arduiniana.org/libraries/pstring/

See Iridium_9603_Beacon.pdf for the PCB schematics
The Iridium_9603_Beacon PCB is based extensively on the Adafruit Feather M0 (Adalogger)
https://www.adafruit.com/products/2796
https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/adafruit-feather-m0-adalogger.pdf
Set the Arduino Board to Adafruit Feather M0
GPS data provided by Adafruit Ultimate GPS
https://www.adafruit.com/products/790
Pressure (altitude) and temperature provided by MPL3115A2
Requires Adafruit's MPL3115A2 library
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MPL3115A2_Library

Uses RTCZero to provide sleep functionality (on the M0)

With grateful thanks to CaveMoa for his SimpleSleepUSB example
https://github.com/cavemoa/Feather-M0-Adalogger
https://github.com/cavemoa/Feather-M0-Adalogger/tree/master/SimpleSleepUSB
Note: you will need to close and re-open your serial monitor each time the M0 wakes up

Iridium 9603 is interfaced to the M0 using Serial2
D6 (Port A Pin 20) = Enable (Sleep) : Connected to 9603 ON/OFF Pin 5
D10 (Port A Pin 18) = Serial2 TX : Connected to 9603 Pin 6
D12 (Port A Pin 19) = Serial2 RX : Connected to 9603 Pin 7
A3 / D17 (Port A Pin 4) = Network Available : Connected to 9603 Pin 19

Iridium 9603 is powered from Linear Technology LTC3225 SuperCapacitor Charger
(fitted with 2 x 1F 2.7V caps e.g. Bussmann HV0810-2R7105-R)
to provide the 1.3A peak current when the 9603 is transmitting

D5 (Port A Pin 15) = LTC3225 ~Shutdown
A1 / D15 (Port B Pin 8) = LTC3225 PGOOD

Ultimate GPS is interfaced to the M0 using Serial1
D1 (Port A Pin 10) = Serial1 TX : Connected to GPS RX
D0 (Port A Pin 11) = Serial1 RX : Connected to GPS TX
D11 (Port A Pin 16) = GPS ENable : Connected to Q1 (DMG3415U-7) Gate

MPL3115A2 Pressure (Altitude) and Temperature Sensor
D20 (Port A Pin 22) = SDA : Connected to MPL3115A2 SDA
D21 (Port A Pin 23) = SCL : Connected to MPL3115A2 SCL

D13 (Port A Pin 17) = Red LED
D9 (Port A Pin 7) = AIN 7 : Battery Voltage / 2

If you have manufactured and populated the PCB yourself, you will need to install the Adafruit bootloader:
Get yourself a Segger J-Link programmer and connect it according to Atmel_SAMD21_Programming_Cable.pdf
Ignore the RST connection
Connect the 5V-Supply output from the J-Link to VBAT / BAT+ to power the board while you configure it
See https://learn.adafruit.com/proper-step-debugging-atsamd21-arduino-zero-m0/restoring-bootloader for more details
